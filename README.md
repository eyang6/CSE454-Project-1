# Fuzzy Movement Robot Controller
Move a robot from point A to B with fuzzy logic.

## Purpose
- Control the acceleration and turning of a robot to make it reach a destination

## Usage
1. On the prompt, enter the starting coordinates of the robot in the format: x,y and hit enter
2. On the second prompt, enter the destination coordinates in the same format

The robot will then start to move towards the destination, outputting its coordinates, speed, angular velocity, and membership function weights every 0.1s
